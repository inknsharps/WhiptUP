# WhiptUp
WhiptUp is a recipe generator that allows a user to input ingredients that they have on hand, and select from dietary restrictions, then recipes are generated, that include all the items that the user has selected.
WhiptUp is focused on reducing food waste so the application will provide addresses and information for food scrap drop off locations in NYC.

A link to the deployed application is available [here](https://inknsharps.github.io/WhiptUP/).
